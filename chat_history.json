You want to create a mobile app to track the education of respiratory therapists working in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A welcoming screen displaying a summary of the therapist's educational progress, upcoming training, and any urgent updates.\n*   **Training Modules:** A section to access and complete training modules. This could include reading materials, videos, quizzes, and hands-on simulations.\n*   **Progress Tracking:** A system to record completed training, test scores, and certifications. This will allow therapists and supervisors to monitor individual and team progress.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray, providing a clean and calming feel)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark gray, for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium gray, for less important information)\n    *   Primary: `#81D4FA` (Light blue, associated with healthcare and calmness)\n    *   Secondary: `#4FC3F7` (Slightly darker blue, for interactive elements)\n    *   Accent: `#03A9F4` (Bright blue, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White, for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#B2EBF2` (Very light blue, for subtle emphasis)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a professional and easy-to-read interface.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** The project is already set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **Home Screen:** Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to create the home screen with a summary of educational progress.\n3.  **Training Modules Screen:** Create a new screen, possibly within the `app/(tabs)` directory, to display available training modules. This might involve creating a new file like `app/(tabs)/training.tsx`.\n4.  **Progress Tracking:** Update the `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` screen to include a section for tracking completed training, scores, and certifications.\n5.  **Navigation:** Ensure seamless navigation between the home screen, training modules, and profile screen using the `expo-router`. The `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file likely handles the tab navigation.\n6.  **Styling:** Apply the specified color palette and typography to the components for a consistent and visually appealing design.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-01T05:02:53.378507"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile app for tracking education for respiratory therapists in a NICU.
